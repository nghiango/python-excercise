* *Problem 6*:
    * Status: solved
    * Path: beginner/how_many_sheets
    * Write a program that allows users enter amount of money, then program should show how many sheets with values 10.000vnd, 5.000vnd, 2.000vnd and 1.000vnd.
        * For example: 543.000vnd = 54 sheets of 10.000vnd + 0 sheet of 5.000vnd + 1 sheet of 2.000vnd + 1 sheet of 1.000vnd.

        * From 2 to 5 km has the price is 13.500vnd
        * From 6 km onwards costs 11.000vnd
        * If travelling more than 120km will be reduced on the total amount.
