## Python excercise

- [x] Exercise 1 
    * Path: beginner/quadratic_equation.py
    * Given a `quadrantic equation 2` with three parameters a, b, and c follow the format `a.x^2 + b.x + c = 0`. Write a program that allows people enter three parameters and finds the `roots` of it.


- [x] Exercise 2 
    * Path: otherProblems/mathAboutSquare.py
    * Write a program for `square` that has some formulars about it followed these functions below:
        * Calculate area.
        * Calculate width when user enter square area.
        * Calculate perimeter.
        * Calculate width when user enter perimeter.
        * Calculate volume cube.
        * Calculate width when user enter volume cube.
        * Calculate area around.
        * Calculate width when user enter surface area cube.
        * Calculate width when user enter four surface area cube.
        * Calculate full area.

- [ ] Exercise 3
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users to enter a radius of circle then calculate perimeter and area of it.

- [ ] Exercise 4
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users enter year of birth then show their years old.

- [ ] Exercise 5
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users to enter two parameters `a` and `b`, then define which one is min, and max.

- [x] Exercise 6
    * Path: beginner/how_many_sheets
    * Write a program that allows users enter amount of money, then program should show how many sheets with values 10.000vnd, 5.000vnd, 2.000vnd and 1.000vnd.
        * For example: 543.000vnd = 54 sheets of 10.000vnd + 0 sheet of 5.000vnd + 1 sheet of 2.000vnd + 1 sheet of 1.000vnd.

- [ ] Exercise 7
    * Path: beginner/sum_of_int_itselt.py
    * Write a program that allows users enter an integer, then calculate sum of all number in itself.
        * For example: 
            * input: 12345
            * output: 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

- [ ] Exercise 8
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users enter three parameters `a` ,`b`, `c` which are widths of a triangle, then define some functions below:
        * Does it a triangle?
        * If yes, please show the type of it(normal, isosceles, right-angled, equilateral, isosceles right triangle)

- [ ] Exercise 9
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program calculates taxi fare from the number of kilometers entered by user, and follow below rules:
        * The first km has the price is 15.000vnd
        * From 2 to 5 km has the price is 13.500vnd
        * From 6 km onwards costs 11.000vnd
        * If travelling more than 120km will be reduced 10% on the total amount.

- [x] Exercise 10
    * Path: beginner/buble_sort.py
    * Write a program allows users enter three parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, then sort it by asc.

- [ ] Exercise 11
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users enter `name`, `math mark`, `physical mark`, `chemiscal mark`, and then let user know which kind of ceritificate that can receive, but the rule should follow declaration below:
        * Good: >= 8.0
        * Fair: >= 6.5
        * Poor: >= 5
        * Below Average: >= 3.5
        * Weak: the others

- [ ] Exercise 12
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows users enter a number, then calcualte sum base on this number and follow below rule:
        * $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n$
        * $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3$
        * $1 + {\frac 1 2} + {\frac 1 3} + ... + {\frac 1 n}$
        * $1 + \frac 1 {1*2} + \frac 1 {2*3} + \frac 1 {3*4} + ... + \frac 1 {(n-1)*n}$
        * $1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!$

- [ ] Exercise 13
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows user enter a number, then calcualte sum all numbers which are smaller than given number and divisible by 4 but not 5.

- [ ] Exercise 14
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows user enter a number, then check the given number is a prime number or not.

- [ ] Exercise 15
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows user enter a number, then find a biggest prime number, but smaller than given number.

- [ ] Exercise 16
    * Path: beginner/
    * Write a program that allows user converts from decimal base to binit or binit to decimal base.

- [ ] Exercise 17
    * Path: beginner/
    * We have many values of money such as 50.000, 20.000, 10.000, 5.000, 2.000, 1.000. Write a program allows user enters an amount of money he/she has, then the program should let he/she knows how many sheets of each value that sum of all is the given amount. The program needs to give all solutions can be happened, and then decide which solution is the best.
